# DNA Sequence Analysis

## Motivation
Understanding DNA base composition(GC %) helps compare genes across species and can provide insight into DNA stability and regulation. This is becuse GC has 3 hydrogen bonds and more GC content more stable the DNA

## Project Overview
This project analyzes DNA sequences from public genomic databases to:
- Calculate nucleotide frequencies (A, T, C, G)
- Compute GC content
- Visualize differences between species

## Tools Used
- Python
- Biopython
- Matplotlib

## Status
In progress
